# Hello-and-Goodbye-Coordinators
A simple coordinator project

I have previously used coordinators, but it has been a few months and I needed a review, so I decided to make this small project. 

The project demostrates a simple Coordinator pattern introduced by Soroush Khanlou at the NSSpain conference in 2015.
I originally learned the Coordinator pattern from Paul Hudson at Hacking with Swift and always use his article and video as a reference. The link to his article can be found here. https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/71/how-to-use-the-coordinator-pattern-in-ios-apps

Hope this helps!
